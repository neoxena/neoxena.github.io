Welcome to neoXena. I am [Michael](/about), neoXena is starting life as my blog as I tinker.

I'm experienced at building system software for use in production at scale. Much of my career has been focused on databases, and specifically storage engines. I am also interested in operating systems, virtual machines, programming languages (including compilers and runtimes), machine learning and its many applications, scaling development teams (including co-design of software architecture with organizations), and the interplay of open source software with industry.

For now my plan is to work through my reading list, taking this opportunity to update my knowledge and gain more than a cursory understanding of recent trends across these areas. I'll post here as I learn.
